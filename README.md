MSFS 2020 Flight plans between Augusta Maine to Sacramento California.<br />
I got this idea from Ron Krassin via Facebook<br />

Ron created the map he used followed to fly from Maine to Oregon, hitting all the capital cities to the main 49 states.<br />

I created a plan for several legs in MSFS 2020 from East to West.  I created a slightly different path but still hits all the state capital cities.<br />

Files:
Flight Plan.txt is a list of the airport identifies.

ACROSS THE USA-1 through 6, and 6a, 6b are alternate routes.  I should cut this line in half.
6 is Phoenix to Olympia, as planned by Ron.
6a is Phoenix to Olympia, starts in Phoenix through Sacramento then north.
6b is Phoenix to Sacramento heading north first then back down the west coast.

The PLN files include departure airport, destination, and all the capital airport waypoints in between.
Save these files to location where MSFS 202 saved FLight Plans.  You can create a basic flight and click [space] to save.  this will give you the default location.

After loading the flight plan, you can change the aircraft, and departure point at the airport.  For example, I like to start at a parking space.  If you change anything else, you could remove the waypoints in between.  If you accidently do that, re-load the flight plan.
You can save the flight plan along the way.  Just use a different name so you can recognize it.
