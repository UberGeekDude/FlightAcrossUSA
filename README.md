MSFS 2020 Flight plans between Augusta Maine to Sacramento California.<br />
I got this idea from Ron Krassin via Facebook<br />
https://www.facebook.com/groups/101987210144851/user/100001674066836/<br />
Ron created the map he used followed to fly from Maine to Oregon, hitting all the capital cities to the main 49 states.<br />

<br />
I created a plan for several legs in MSFS 2020 from East to West.  I created a slightly different path but still hits all the state capital cities.<br />
<br />
Files:<br />
Flight Plan.txt is a list of the airport identifies.<br />
<br />
ACROSS THE USA-1 through 6, and 6a, 6b are alternate routes.  I should cut this line in half.<br />
6 is Phoenix to Olympia, as planned by Ron.<br />
6a is Phoenix to Olympia, starts in Phoenix through Sacramento then north.<br />
6b is Phoenix to Sacramento heading north first then back down the west coast.<br />
<br />
The PLN files include departure airport, destination, and all the capital airport waypoints in between.<br />
Save these files to location where MSFS 202 saved FLight Plans.  You can create a basic flight and click [space] to save.  this will give you the default location.<br />
<br />
After loading the flight plan, you can change the aircraft, and departure point at the airport.  For example, I like to start at a parking space.  If you change anything else, you could remove the waypoints in between.  If you accidently do that, re-load the flight plan.
You can save the flight plan along the way.  Just use a different name so you can recognize it.<br />
